# Intel 8086 Microprocessor

In 1978, Intel launched the 8086 16-bit microprocessor and it gave rise to the x86 architecture. The 8086 consisted of 29,000 transistors, 40-pin dual in-line package and clock speed of 5 MHz - 10 MHz.

The x86 is a family of complex instruction set architectures; the term “86” came from the 8086. The decoder interprets common instructions from the instruction-set such as; mov, add, sub, cmp and conditional jumps.
